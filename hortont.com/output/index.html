<p>
<p>Hello everyone! I know I haven&#8217;t been much around lately <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-sad.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  life as a student is kind of dominating me. I am working on a Clutter based slide show application now (for the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu/ <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-smile-big.png" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> , thanks Sean O&#8217;Sullivan and Professor Moorthy) and I&#8217;m pretty committed to making a release in about two weeks. I&#8217;m pretty excited about this, but that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>
<p>I wanted to take an opportunity to show some awesome stuff people have been doing, and thank them for it, because I&#8217;ve been bad about replying to emails. A lot of people have been doing some cool stuff with Seed lately, so in no particular order&#8230;some cool stuff.</p>
<p>Alan Knowles has created a Seed documentation site (http://devel.akbkhome.com/seed/) generated from the code at http://git.gnome.org/browse/introspection-doc-generator/. I think this has been a clear gap missing, as C documentation can be a little intimidating for some people (despite how easy we C hackers would find it to translate). Alan spoke to me recently about maybe moving this in to gnome-js-common and I am all for it, hopefully something to that effect will happen for the next few days.</p>
<p>Alan also has a blog at http://alsaf1.wordpress.com/, where he&#8217;s been writing up some Seed tutorials. I&#8217;m really excited to have this sort of documentation for Seed, as it was&#8230;another gap! which neither the examples, or the few documents really fulfilled. </p>
<p>Alan has also been fixing a lot of bugs and just generally being awesome.</p>
<p>On the other Alan front, Alan Forbes has been helpful on the mailing list and has written a very introductory level tutorial at http://live.gnome.org/Seed/Tutorial.</p>
<p>Alexandre Mazari has written something called  http://gitorious.org/seedkit, which I think is a really cool concept, and one I&#8217;ve thought about since the inception of Seed, I haven&#8217;t looked in to the implementation much yet though. Alexandre also fixed some bugs. Thanks <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-smile-big.png" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>A few other people have been fixing some bugs lately&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to name everyone for risk of missing someone, but thanks <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-smile-big.png" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> . I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on Seed lately, but have been excited lately to see people using it. Even though development has definitely slowed, I feel like a lot of the worst bugs have been solved, and as far as I know there are quite a few people out there trying to make applications with it (who occasionally send me emails!). I was excited to see the Seed based same-gnome rewrite on the 2.30 release notes, and I hope people are enjoying it <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-smile-big.png" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Speaking of clutter-gnome-game-wizards. A big thanks to Tim Horton too, Seed never would have happened without Tim, and he keeps it going when I&#8217;m too holed away to pay attention to emails. Maybe an apology to Tim also.</p>
<p>School is going well&#8230;have to finish a radiosity solver today <img src="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/wp-content/mu-plugins/tango-smilies/tango/face-sad.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> . Summer is approaching fast! If anymore interesting summer jobs  than staying in Troy and hacking from home&#8230;</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/03/30/223242.html">Tim and Carol in NYC</a></h4>
<p>
About three months ago, <a href="http://www.sheandhim.com/">She &amp; Him</a> announced a few tour dates for their then-unreleased second album, the aptly-named Volume Two. I was scanning the list, noticing a severe lack of "Albany", "Boston", or "Burlington", when two dates in New York City caught my eye. The Bowery Ballroom - March 29th and 30th, they said. I asked Amy if she could go, but - being a Monday, a school day - she wasn't going to be able to pull that off.<br /><br />Once I got back to RPI (in late January), I asked Carol (and Nate) if I could steal her for a day at the end of March. She managed to get a day off from work, and we got tickets to the concert and various forms of transportation. Getting concert tickets was a bit of a pain &mdash; the internet has made it very easy for scalpers to immediately consume the entire supply of tickets, especially to very small shows like this &mdash; but we eventually got it all sorted out.<br /><br />As March drew to a close, it became clear that the 29th was going to be a disgustingly rainy day, both in NYC and Troy. "Oh, well," we said as we boarded a Megabus nearby the local Amtrak station &mdash; we were determined to make something awesome of the day, regardless of the weather.<br /><br />We rode, chatted, and tried to nap on the top level of the double-decker bus all the way to Penn Station, getting in at just after 1 PM. After getting out and getting oriented, we meandered up Seventh Ave., heading in the general direction of <a href="http://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a>, one of our potential plans for the few hours we had before the concert. On the way, we decided that food might be nice, and stopped at a small Chinese place called <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=4935347702941055105&q=Ginger's&hl=en&cd=1&ei=rcyyS5esE6TqzASP650g&sll=40.749984,-73.985519&sspn=0.018341,0.032405&ie=UTF8&ll=40.771117,-74.015236&spn=0,0&z=14">Ginger's</a> which Carol spotted. The food was surprisingly good for a Chinese place, and we moved on, satisfied.<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/carol-nyc/church.jpg" /><br /><br />After a filling lunch, the subway seemed like a good option &mdash; in addition, we knew we were going to need to figure out the MTA so we could get to the concert on time. In retrospect I'm very glad we did this, as it turns out they made the horribly unfortunate choice (unlike Boston's MBTA) of putting maps <em>after</em> you've gone through the ticket machines, which through me off significantly.<br /><br />The subway eventually put us relatively close to MoMA (ordinarily this would have been walking distance, but the rain coupled with the fact that we only had a single gigantic awkward-for-tight-NYC-streets umbrella with us led us to opt for the subway). We got down to the museum, only to spot enormous lines of people with the <em>exact</em> same idea. Walking through the lobby observing the crowds only cemented my belief that we'd <em>never</em> get in if we waited there. So, we gave up on that idea &mdash; we'll be back another day &mdash; and headed towards another <em>classic</em> NYC museum: the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. Carol had been to the Met before, but noted that there was so much to see that she'd happily go again; I've never managed to visit either, myself.<br /><br />Heading towards the Met, we walked through the puddles and mud up Fifth Ave., past many sights I've seen a few times before &mdash; Trump Tower, the iconic Apple Store, FAO Schwarz, etc. &mdash; up to Central Park. We decided that the umbrella would be less painful in the park, which seemed relatively empty, so we left the road for the somewhat-depressingly-wet park walkways.<br /><br />I should note now that while it may seem like we shouldn't have been having a good time, between the weather and the crowded museum, we were actually having a lot of fun just enjoying the city and hanging out and looking around and chatting and such. As you'd expect!<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/carol-nyc/carol.jpg" /><br /><br />The walk through the park was greatly improved by the various flowers just starting to pop out of the ground &mdash; it's pretty clear spring is on it's way, even if we have a month of rain ahead of us. We eventually got to the seemingly completely deserted Met, only to read the sign stating that they're closed on Mondays. I feel like I actually discovered this the <em>last</em> time I was in NYC, but I'd forgotten until we got there. I suppose that this somewhat explains the ridiculous lines at MoMA, but was rather unfortunate for us; we managed to spend a few hours wandering the city with our plan of getting inside out of the rain for a while continually falling down around us.<br /><br />We decided to forego that plan and head (by subway, thank god) to Times Square and wander around some more (a pretty reasonable NYC backup plan, I guess!), which went well. I don't think Carol was particularly entertained by my reluctance to enjoy the various crazy stores (Hershey's, the M&amp;M store, Toys R Us, etc.) around there, but nobody ever is! Oh, well!<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/carol-nyc/times.jpg" /><br /><br />At this point it was getting late &mdash; time for dinner, and to find our way to the Bowery Ballroom for the show. We decided to combine these things; the Bowery is smack dab in the middle of the Chinatown/Little Italy region, so we once again went underground and found ourselves in a new part of the city. After a short bit of looking around, we found (by found, I mean the guy standing outside the door managed to entice Carol to come inside with his descriptions of various dishes, while I was fussing with my phone trying to find things with Yelp) an excellent little Italian place, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=10643962722416317301&q=Paesano+of+Mulberry+Street&cd=1&ei=TD-1S6aJN4LaMfTYuOcC&sig2=UZAol-NkrwwaYJoI-XlPTg&sll=40.721177,-73.993671&sspn=0.007725,0.010021&ie=UTF8&ll=40.719656,-73.998687&spn=0,0&z=19&iwloc=lyrftr:m,10643962722416317301,40.718603,-73.997566">Paesano's</a>, which served <em>fabulous</em> &mdash; if somewhat overportioned &mdash; food. I don't think either of us came close to finishing our dinners, but we certainly both agreed that they were excellent, and were impressed that food wasn't the problem that it usually is on trips like these. The atmosphere there was nice, too... the waiters were really nice, and totally on their game the whole time. I'd definitely recommend it, if you happen to end up in the area.<br /><br />Seven thirty eventually rolled around, and it was time to head over for the show, which started at 8 (or so I thought). We found the Bowery with no problem; it took us a minute to determine whether or not we could go inside, as there were tons of people standing around (apparently waiting for others). After making our way through the real-life-gigantic-scary bouncers, we found ourselves in a dimly lit room filled with the sort of crowd that frequents these sorts of things. I'm not totally sure how to describe them, but if you'd been there, you'd know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />It turned out that the show didn't really start until 9:00, so we stood inside the ballroom for an hour, chatting and observing the crowd. Eventually the starting band came on &mdash; the super-hippie harmony group <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thelivingsisters">The Living Sisters</a>. While it was clear that they were technically-competent and actually all had quite excellent voices, Carol and I were in agreement that it wasn't something we'd buy and listen to on our own. Still, they certainly <em>entertained</em> us... maybe nod in the way they'd hoped, but I suppose it was worth something!<br /><br />It was at this point that we realized we had a serious problem &mdash; She &amp; Him still hadn't come on at 9:30, and our train out was at 10:50, 20 minutes from where we were. We spend a good part of the intermission IMing and texting everyone from school trying to find someone who knew someone who lived in NYC, looking for a couch to crash on (there was no way I was going to leave without my concert!). After quite a bit of semi-panicked chatting, I decided to let Mom freak out, and sent her a text asking if she had any ideas. Luckily, I CC-ed Amy, who &mdash; after a bit of searching &mdash; found a bus company who had a 12:01 AM bus to Albany. Success!<br /><br />If it hadn't been for Amy, we would have ended up camping out in Penn Station or the 5th Ave. Apple Store, neither of which would have gone over well with the staff, I suppose.<br /><br />As it was, we only got to see about half of Zooey &amp; Matt's show, but it was enough to make me very happy &mdash; it was exactly what I was hoping for, and I had a great time! Zooey is still adorable in person, they all sang/played very well, and thankfully played a mix of songs from both Volume One and Volume Two. You could tell when a song was from Volume One, as the whole crowd was able to sing along; Volume Two came out like a week before the concert, and nobody's really familiar with it (except for <em>In The Sun</em>, which was released as a single) yet!<br /><br />All in all, it was one of my favorite concerts, even considering the fact that I missed half of it (she covered a lot of the awesome stuff; I only really missed <em>Sentimental Heart</em>, my personal favorite)! I'm really, really glad I went, I'm glad I dragged Carol along with me (I'm not sure the whole day would have worked out as well/smoothly with just about anybody else), I'm glad we waited, and I'm glad it all worked out.<br /><br />So, yeah, the concert was <em>excellent</em>! Hopefully at some point in the future I'll get to take Amy and stay for the whole thing :-)<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/carol-nyc/artists.png" /><br /><br />Most of the rest of the evening went off without a hitch; we got to the bus <em>just</em> on time, having taken a taxi (some random people saw Carol's distress at trying to hail a taxi and got one for her; that's something I probably wouldn't have been able to pull off at all!) to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Once on the bus, we realized that we should probably look up where it was going <em>to</em>, since it seemed unlikely to take us to the train station, where our car was. Indeed, the bus was destined for the Greyhound station in Albany, on the wrong side of the river (though only a mile from the car, it was 3 AM, not an ideal time to make that walk!)... back to AIM, searching for people at school who would still be awake at 3 AM!<br /><br />Ryan had already been planning to stay up all night, so he came and saved us (for which we are eternally grateful!), shuttling us over the bridge to Carol's car. We got home at around 3:30, grabbed water, and promptly fell asleep (some more soundly than others, apparently).<br /><br />All-in-all, it was an absolutely awesome day for all involved. We had a lot of fun, and perhaps we'll do something similar again (in a few months, after we've recovered from this trip!)...</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/03/23/131751.html">A Miraculous Recovery</a></h4>
<p>
Or, <em>How I Baked My 400$ Logic Board In An Oven For Ten Minutes And Successfully Repaired It</em>...<br /><br /><strong>Take One</strong><br /><br />On one day nearly two years ago, one year after I'd acquired my current MacBook Pro, Kaylee, I <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/2008/06/macbook-pro-santa-rosa-a-fatal-flaw/">opened the lid to a black screen</a>. A black screen which <em>stayed</em> black, no matter what I tried to do. It was booting, though &mdash; using ioreg over ssh, I determined that it thought my video card (the now-somewhat-aging but still powerful NVIDIA 8600M) had suddenly become an integrated Intel X3100 &mdash; something which, barring the existence of gremlins or elves, had certainly not happened.<br /><br />At that point, few people had heard of the NVIDIA 8-series solder failures. Approximately a week after my machine died, NVIDIA took a 150 million dollar hit to predicted revenue for that quarter to cover the fact that some of their mobile GPU lines were failing at "higher than usual" rates. Some people today believe that the entire 8-series was affected, even the desktop chips, but that the mobile chips failed at far greater rates because of the inherently more unfortunate thermal conditions within a laptop. It turned out that some of the solder connecting the GPU to the motherboard (or to the discrete card, in the case of the desktop chips) was of poor quality, developing cracks over time with repeated heating and cooling cycles.<br /><br />I took my machine to Small Dog Electronics, who subsequently sent it to Apple for a logic board replacement. This was before Apple knew what was going on; before (almost a year, actually) the repair program was in place, so I convinced my parents (thanks, again!) to pay for the repairs.<br /><br /><strong>Take Two </strong><br /><br />Fast forward to Saturday; almost two years after the first failure. Wake up Kaylee, no backlight. Power off, try again. Black screen, no backlight, but the disk sounds like it's booting just fine. I eventually managed to enable SSH (by pulling the disk out and attaching it to another machine) and noted that &mdash; once again &mdash; my video card reported itself as a Intel X3100. Grr...<br /><br />This time around, I didn't really see repair as an option. While Apple now has a free repair program for this problem, I've beat my machine far beyond the point where any sane company would accept it for repairs even if I were to <em>throw</em> money at them. I didn't bother to even try. Besides, I'm really just waiting for new models and then I'm going to replace it, so it's hard to justify much effort to keep this machine alive.<br /><br />On Sunday I stripped the MacBook Pro down, disconnecting everything from the motherboard, removing it, applying heat from a hairdryer and massaging the GPU... I figured, at this point, I've got nothing to lose, so I'll try it. I had to reapply thermal paste and reattach the heatsink, all that fun stuff. After reconnecting everything, no dice. I offered bits and pieces to other people (battery and memory are still useful), and put Kaylee in a box.<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/nvidia-mbp-gpu.jpg" /><br /><br />Monday rolled around, and my father pointed out that BGA solder doesn't actually melt at a temperature that you can achieve with a hairdryer, but that an oven at around 400&deg;F should do it... so I decided that I'd try that as a last-ditch attempt.<br /><br />Strip the machine back down, remove the motherboard again, throw it in the oven at 380&deg;F for 10 minutes, wrapped in aluminum foil except for a small hole above the GPU.<br /><br />Put it all back together, turn it on. The power light <em>blinks</em>... that's not right! I eventually realized that I forgot to put the RAM back in. Fix that, hit the power button again... <strong>GRAY SCREEN</strong>! And it booted, happily.<br /><br />I still don't believe it worked &mdash; it's by far the most incredible and amazing repair I've ever performed, and I'm incredibly happy that it both didn't melt the CPU and actually managed to fix the GPU (I'm sitting here waiting for class to start, typing away on Kaylee...).</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/03/07/035116.html">Things I'm Excited For, Early 2010 Edition</a></h4>
<p>
<img src="http://files.hortont.com/yay-all.png" /><br /><br />There's all sorts of exciting things to think about right now!<br /><br />First off, this is spring break, so I have a nice week to relax without too much worry about school stuff. Second off, it's also show week for Amy, so that means there's going to be an awesome Colchester Theatre Company production to partake in at the end of the week! Dad says the set is enormous, and Amy hasn't started worrying about things coming together as much as she usually does, so it should be excellent! Being home also means getting to see Kaitlyn for the first time since winter break, which should be awesome :-) All wonderful things!<br /><br />Next, Carol and I are going to New York City (center of the universe!) in three weeks (on the 29th)! I acquired tickets to see Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_%26_Him">She &amp; Him</a>) at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Ballroom">Bowery Ballroom</a> in Manhattan, and I'm super excited! I haven't been able to stop playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_One_(She_%26_Him_album)">Volume One</a> since I first heard it (shortly after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(500)_Days_of_Summer">(500) Days of Summer</a> was released). I think we're going to go down early enough to also spend some time in NYC &mdash; it's always a treat to hang out with Carol, doubly so with her only being in Troy on weekends this semester!<br /><br />Ah, yes, there's an Apple logo up there. There really ought to be MacBook Pros coming out... this is coming close to being the longest time between MBP/PowerBook updates <em>ever</em> (or at least since ~2002)... just when it's time to upgrade. Come on, guys! But that makes me even more excited to see what they're working on (I hope!)... Luckily Dad's display clamps seem to be holding Kaylee together for the time being, so my last post about this topic was a little premature.<br /><br />And finally, games! I was excited for <a href="http://www.supremecommander2.com/">Supreme Commander 2</a>, but that already happened, and didn't totally deliver on the excitement (I don't like it when they dumb down übercomplicated games after you've gotten used to the complication). Valve, however, most likely won't fail me, so I'm allowed to frantically anticipate the recently announced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2">Portal 2</a> as much as I want to! Portal is one of my favorite games, and was actually my first WASD+mouse game (make whatever of that you will), so it holds a special place in my heart (and how could you <em>not</em> adore the companion cube? it even speaks to you!). On top of that, they seem to be <a href="http://news.google.com/news/story?client=safari&rls=en&q=steam+os+x&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ncl=d9hYvbdI3dzl8dMJqq6w8uX2k6NsM&hl=en&ei=c26TS-CNOIyXtgfo6LzVCg&sa=X&oi=news_result&ct=more-results&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQqgIwAw">hinting at</a> (with awesome fake Apple ads) an announcement of &mdash; gasp &mdash; a port of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)">Source</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(content_delivery)">Steam</a> to OS X, which would be <em>totally</em> awesome, especially with a new laptop to go with it!<br /><br /><b>EDIT:</b> Valve officially announced Steam + Source for Mac, as well as the ability to play games you've purchased in Windows on OS X for free. Awesome! They never disappoint... except Ep. 3...</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/03/07/025228.html">Slow Transition to S3</a></h4>
<p>
I finished another part of my slow transition away from Dreamhost and on to Amazon's <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> for this site last night: I deleted everything related to this domain from Dreamhost. This meant setting up the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> proxy I've been thinking about for a while (which ended up being a just slight bit of horrific hackery upon <a href="http://shrub.appspot.com/">shrub</a>), and moving my DNS stuff back to the much-less-flexible 1and1 servers (which I get for free with my registration). This is a really ugly solution, because it adds another bounce for all HTML pages, but it <em>still</em> seems to be faster than Dreamhost, somehow.<br /><br />It's mostly all working - unfortunately, GAE apps can't run on a naked domain, so the <em>www</em> is required now - any links to a subdirectory of hortont.com will redirect <em>to the toplevel page</em>. But I decided the temporary inconvenience was well worth the ~10$/month savings, so that's OK.<br /><br />Also, links from more than 8-10 months ago are completely invalid now (I had a bunch of redirects, before, but they're gone now too in the shuffle). But that's OK, too. Really, who keeps around links to my blog? All of the internal links should be valid... I guess the big issue is things subscribed to RSS feeds with the naked domain. (I've already fixed a few random things I've found with this... I should check on Planet Gnome and stuff, too...)<br /><br />I just have to move Carol and Matt, and then everything will be great - I've spent less than a dollar over the course of 2 months or so of S3... excellent!<br /><br />I expect to find things broken over the course of the next few days... if anyone else runs into anything, let me know!<br /><br />The <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/shrub">proxy code</a> is on Github.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/02/26/133658.html">Sheeple, One Semester In</a></h4>
<p>
Last semester, during <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/11/11/084020.html">RCOS</a>, I started working on a contact-management application for GNOME (Seed is mostly in maintenance mode, at this point), called (for lack of a better name, at the moment) <a href="http://www.hortont.com/projects/sheeple/">Sheeple</a>. I keep a carefully-organized, constantly-updated address book, so I spend a bit of time in whatever contact-management program I'm using, so this is something that matters a good bit to me personally.<br /><br />The de-facto application for managing contacts on GNOME at the moment is, of course, the behemoth personal-information-management suite, Evolution. Evolution has a <em>long</em> history, and is a large codebase, written by a lot of people, over a very long time. It also looks a little bit outdated:<br /><br /><a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-evolution-contacts.png"><img width="600px" src="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-evolution-contacts.png" /></a><br /><br />Not a pretty sight. Not to me, anyway, not in 2010, when my alternative is:<br /><br /><img width="600px" src="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-ab-contacts.png" /><br /><br />Another fundamental difference between the two is in their editing functionality. Address Book provides the ability to edit contacts inline; Evolution requires you to edit contact information in an overly-limited (while it can store more than four email addresses per contact, you can only edit four in the editor window... what!?) separate window.<br /><br /><img width="600px" src="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-ab-editing.png" /><br /><br />I decided to start working on a more Address Book-like application for GNOME. After a bit of deliberation, I decided to have it backed by Evolution's evolution-data-server, so that people's contacts would transition over smoothly. This might have been a mistake, because the EDS API isn't beautiful, and there are very few complete, working bindings, but I've made it mostly work.<br /><br />It's written (mostly - the EDS-related code is straight C, unfortunately) in <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. It's my first Vala program, so it's been a learning experience — Vala seems nice, though there are a few bugs (I've reported one glaring bug which was acknowledged, though it hasn't been fixed yet), and some bindings are a little sketchy.<br /><br />During the development, I discovered that Nokia was developing libosso-abook (for Maemo), an address book library that provides a lot of the functionality that I was planning for libsheeple. Unfortunately, libosso-abook is currently <em>closed</em>-source. Not cool, Nokia... Anyway, if they open-source it (it's under consideration, at the moment), I'll probably ditch most of libsheeple and base the Sheeple UI on top of that, because it's a <em>ton</em> of annoying code already done.<br /><br />After the end of last semester, I had the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-editor.png"><img width="600px" src="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-editor.png" /></a><br /><br />Lots of things are broken, but it's something. I don't have working syncing yet, and I believe <em>writing</em> back to EDS is broken at the moment (so no persistence of changes!), but those are things I plan on working on this semester...<br /><br />There are <a href="http://www.hortont.com/projects/sheeple/">slides and stuff</a> available, too.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/posts/2010/02/19/142147.html">Punkin'</a></h4>
<p>
In September of 1997 &mdash; long before I can really remember &mdash; Vivian and Margaret adopted two then-very-young kittens, Peanut, and Punkin. Over the course of the last 13 years, we've visited them more times than I can possibly count, quickly becoming good friends.<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/punkin09.jpg" /><br /><br />Punkin was always the more friendly of the two. Peanut was often skittish, hiding from deluges of affection which his brother would take rather in stride and return tenfold, every single time.<br /><br />While we all certainly love Punkin, Peanut, and their adopted sister Troi immensely, it's not &mdash; by any means &mdash; a stretch to say that Punkin was first in most people's hearts, if only because of his ridiculous capacity for affection.<br /><br /><img src="http://files.hortont.com/dadpunkin.jpg" /><br /><br />Unfortunately, he was also first to get sick. A few years back, he developed diabetes; Vivian and Margaret have since given him insulin twice a day and continued to provide a wonderful home and all the love he &mdash; or anyone &mdash; could possibly want.<br /><br />Punkin had to be put to sleep yesterday, due to various complications from his diabetes. It was a sad day for everyone &mdash; this has been very hard to write &mdash; but as he leaves us we can keep in mind all of the incredibly adorable and fun times we all shared with him during the last decade. He was certainly <em>my</em> closest animal friend by far, and may always be. He will be missed by all, and never forgotten.<br /><br />Goodbye.</p>

<p>
I've made an early release of Clutterhs, and it's on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clutterhs">Hackage</a>. There's still a fair number of things that don't work yet, and lots of messy code that needs to be cleaned up, but most of the core stuff should work. There isn't a tutorial yet, but overall usage is similar to gtk2hs. If you want to try it, the best thing to do would be to look at the simple demos in the <a href="http://jayne.hortont.com/git/cgit.cgi/clutterhs.git/tree/clutter/demo">git repo</a>. They aren't very good examples, and just sort of use a bunch of random stuff but they should help with the general idea of how to use it (which is still quite likely to change).</p>

<p>
Sometime between last night and this morning I may have had something of a Eureka moment about all of the problems I've been wondering about. I've realized I made a huge mistake when dealing with GObject Properties / Attributes that should be easy to fix. I missed something huge when looking at how<a title="gtk2hs" href="http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/" target="_blank"> gtk2hs</a> deals with properties. I think I  can now easily avoid doing dirty things which I was very unhappy with to deal with functions which take GValues  (except for maybe the Model stuff).  I'm going to redo the animate* functions so you no longer have to deal with the dirty named property stuff directly, which is very unHaskelly and an obvious source of mistakes, as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>August 18, 2009</h2>




<h3><a href="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net" title="carol">Carol</a></h3>


<h4><a href="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/?p=20">I wrote something! and it WORKED!</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Thats right.  All you Matt Arsenaults and Robert Carrs who think I can&#8217;t do anything. Who tease me for my relentless depending upon Timmy and helplessness when it comes to LITEC (Which, I must point out, I FINISHED. At the very last second, 30 minutes before it was too late to hand in the final report, I finished.)</p>
<p>But I have reached such great heights this summer. I would like to thank Tim Horton for answering my thousands of emails that asked how to unallocate an array or why I had a memory leak or what a pointer is or to simply amuse me while working all day.</p>
<p>I bet all you non-believers are wondering what kind of dinky little piece of code could I have written? Well I tell you it is about as cool as dry ice gets.</p>
<p>Say, for example, Mike Stephens is going skiing on top of Gore Mountain with his sisters and Timmy is going on a picnic with K on top of Pete Gay Mountain  (I don&#8217;t know why Timmy is picnicking at a time of year when Mike is skiing, he&#8217;s kind of silly like that.) At any rate, they want to know whether or not they will be able to see each other so that they can wave. Perhaps they want to pick out a designated waving time so that they will not accidentally wave to strangers.</p>
<p>Timmy and Mike are both going to need a few vital pieces of information. First off, they are going to need to know their starting coordinates. These can be obtained from any mapping program, even Google Earth.  Their locations will probably consist of a Latitude, Longitude and Altitude. Then they need to know the Heading, or direction, they each need to face to wave in the proper direction. They also need to know the elevation angle so that they know whether to look up or down. Then once they both know what directions to face and look they need to know the range, or distance, between them so that they can bring the right strength of binoculars (or telescope) they need to see one another.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they need to know whether or not there is a clear line of sight between their locations. There might be other mountains blocking their view. Without this information their very epic adventures might quickly turn into unfortunately disappointing afternoons.</p>
<p>Boy! Those are a lot of calculations to do by hand. Fortunately I spent a good chunk of time writing LOS.cpp, a C program designed to take in two geodetic coordinates and altitudes.  It then calculates the heading, range, elevation and outputs whether or not there is a clear Line of Sight. Of course it does require a file of SRTM data that contains UTM coordinates and altitudes for the region that includes both mountains. DEM Data from the USGS web site works excellently (you have to create a free account so that they will let you download the files.) The Hamilton County -&gt; Gore Mountain file works well for these mountains, mainly because it contains both of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps then Matt has a wonderful idea. He suggests that since Mike is skiing down the Mountain why don&#8217;t we see how many different points on the hill Mike and Tim can see each other. Normally I would beat Matt for this idea because he is making more work and we hate when makes more work for us. However, after I wrote LOS.cpp, I applied it to write Viewshed_cme.</p>
<p>Viewshed is a program written to compare a path of data points (like a series of points taken on a road), to 1 data point (such as an RF Tower). If we consider the path that Mike is skiing down to be the road and Tim&#8217;s picnic area to be the tower we can find how many points down the hill Mike and Tim can see each other.</p>
<p>This situation would probably make Natey interject. He often enjoys killing my fun, and in this situation that is exactly what he is out to do. He would probably point out that what good is a list of points where you can see each other with out a visual representation of them. Being an EMAC, Natey likes pretty visual things on computers.</p>
<p>I am still a step ahead. Viewshed automatically creates a kml file. When this file is opened in Google Earth it shows a a line from every &#8220;road point&#8221; to the tower point. If the line represents a spot where there is clear LOS it is green. If there is not clear LOS, the line is red.</p>
<p>Because I have sepnt the last few weeks dealing with points along a road and collecting data, I am not going to find a series of points down Gore Mountain. Quite frankly, I am sick of it. If Matt really wants to know he can get me the data points and I will run them through my program and send him the output. Otherwise, take yo dolla&#8217; bill an&#8217; shove it.</p>
<p>I did run viewshed with 1 coordinate for Mike at 43.67645, -74.0351 and 1 coordinate for Tim at 43.69034, -74.0443.</p>
<div id="attachment_21" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-21" title="Histogram of the Path From Gore Mountain to Pete Gay Mountain" src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gore-to-pete-attempt1-300x194.jpg" alt="There is not LOS" width="300" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">There is not LOS</p></div>
<p>Here is an example of a graph made from the Histogram Feature. It shows the elevation of the path between Gore Mountain and Pete Gay Mountain. Because part of Pete Gay Mountain is higher than the starting point Tim cannot picnic on the part of the mountain he intended on picnicking on. But from the data he is able to figure out that if he stands somewhere around 43.68896, -74.0434 he might be able to see Mike better.  Here is the graph of the Histogram for those coordinates:</p>
<div id="attachment_23" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-23" title="Gore to Pete" src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gore-to-pete-attempt-3-300x194.jpg" alt="There IS a clear LOS" width="300" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">There IS a clear LOS</p></div>
<p>And here is the kml file made from this trial opened in Google Earth:</p>
<div id="attachment_24" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-24" title="Path made in Google Earth" src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kml-1024x618.jpg" alt="Pretty Green Path" width="1024" height="618" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pretty Green Path</p></div>
<p>
<p>Note the pretty Details Box that shows up when you click on it <img src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Timmy and Mike are now able to plan their trips up to the mountains. They know that if Tim stands at 43.688964, -74.043393 and Mike stands at 43.676453, -74.035133 they will be able to see each other. Assuming North is zero degrees, Mike would have to look in the direction of 308.67 degrees with an elevation of .033548 degrees.</p>
<p>Everything would be backwards for Timmy- heading of 51.33 degrees and an elevation of -.033548 degrees.</p>
<p>They both need to bring a magnifigying device that will let them see 1543.33 meters &#8211; I am going to let Timmy decide what to use for that <img src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Of course, Matt will probably still think we need to calculate multiple points for Mike to stand at. All I have to say to him is I will do it when you send me points.</p>
<p>
<p>Pretty videos of the data I found for work to come <img src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<h4><a href="http://www.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/blog/posts/2009/07/02/033548.html">Emacs and Vim</a></h4>
<p>
<span> </span>Last week I finally managed to switch to <a title="Emacs" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>. I've meant to try this several times before, in particular when <a href="http://stallman.org/" target="_blank">Richard Stallman</a>, the original author of Emacs, <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/2009/02/rms-rpi/" target="_blank">stayed in my room for a night when he visited RPI</a>. I had been using <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> since I switched to GNU/Linux. At that time, the Emacs keys made no sense. Also, in various Linux-related tutorials, Vim was usually mentioned first and there was no point in learning 2 editors.  I've found that moving around the text in Emacs is a bit easier, and the same as bash (and actually made me aware of more bash shortcuts). Since I had moved on from using qwerty over a year ago, I've been using the arrow keys instead of h, j, k, l. I never bothered to rebind the keys, which also would be annoying.  There are a number of things that annoy me about Emacs.<br /><br />The syntax highlighting in Vim is nicer. First of all, the syntax highlighting of types in C in Emacs figures out what to highlight as a type based on context. Because of this, as you go along the colors change and it's kind of annoying. This also doesn't give you the alert that you would get in Vim when you make a typo and it doesn't change color, although the Vim way had the disadvantage of needing to specify the types in some syntax config file for more obscure types from a certain library, such as mpfr_rnd_t or something like that. Special escaped characters in strings, such as '\n' for newline or '\t' for tab, aren't highlighted in Emacs, but they are in Vim. The whole preprocessor directive is highlighted in Vim, but not in Emacs. Numeric constants aren't highlighted in Emacs. #if 0'd out sections are highlighted as comments, but not in Emacs. These things I could probably configure, although I'm rather lazy and probably won't look into it. My other issue with Emacs syntax highlighting is the theming. There seem to be no good themes in the only large collection I can find. The ones that could almost be the same as my old theme from Vim have odd things wrong with them, such as having strings or comments italicized and totally unreadable.<br /><br />I've lost lots of time trying to get a usable config. I fought especially long trying to get indentation that makes sense. The default "GNU" indentation style is basically the worst thing ever, with braces halfway indented and such. Once I got an indentation style, Emacs forces you to that style. The tab key sent the current line to the "correct" indentation for that line. I wanted tab to just insert 4 spaces, and when I went to a new line to have it go to a suggested indentation level. This was frustrating primarily for 2 reasons. First, I like to indent my comments after lines of code, and try to line my comments up off to the side. I think it looks neater that way. Also, it would not allow you to indent preprocessor directives, which was annoying when dealing with <a href="http://openmp.org/wp/" target="_blank">OpenMP</a>, where it makes sense to indent the #pragmas for parallelizing loops and such. I eventually gave up on getting tab to do what I want, and ended up just using M-i to tab in where I wanted to outside of the indentation guidelines, and rebinding enter to newline and indent.<br /><br /><span> </span>I still can't do everything I used to be able to do in Vim. I haven't looked into a few things yet. But overall, I seem to do things more efficiently, and do things I never bothered learning in Vim. Emacs macros are also wonderful.</p>

<h4><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/06/07/making-your-library-introspectable/">Making your library introspectable.</a></h4>
<p>
<p><a href="http://blog.fubar.dk/">David</a> <a href="http://blog.fubar.dk/?p=106">posted</a> recently on his experiences adding introspection to GUdev (cool!), and this reminded me to bring up something which I think is very useful.</p>
<p>If you are a maintainer of a library, or an application which exposes an API (to plugins, etc&#8230;), please consider adding introspection to your build system! Essentially, what works in the various introspection based bindings, is what we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to test, and every new library shows a few new corner cases, finding these is very useful (this is why in the Seed source tree, there are a large number of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~racarr/seed/">examples</a>, trying to get an idea of how well introspection works with various libraries).</p>
<p>If you are looking for an example of how to do this, Clutter is a very good one I think. Essentially you first need <a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/cgit.cgi?url=clutter/tree/build/autotools/introspection.m4">introspection.m4</a>, and then <code>GOBJECT_INTROSPECTION_CHECK([0.6.3])</code> in <code>configure.ac</code>. Then, to the appropriate <code>Makefile.am</code>, you need to add the actual calls to the scanner and the compiler. See <a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/cgit.cgi?url=clutter/tree/clutter/Makefile.am">libclutter&#8217;s Makefile.am</a> (around line 248). In most cases it will actually be a little simpler than it is in Clutter.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like introspection in your library/app, also feel free to email me, and assuming it&#8217;s not a complicated case, I&#8217;m perfectly willing to cook up a quick patch, and test some things out.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/05/27/uds-seed-08/">UDS, Seed 0.8</a></h4>
<p>
<h2>UDS</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m at UDS this week, and it&#8217;s great as always, I&#8217;m really excited for Karmic as a release on the desktop front. I&#8217;m also looking forward to a session on packaging GObject-introspection stuff later today.</p>
<p>Barcelona seems to be a great city, though I&#8217;ve had a little trouble finding places for dinner, etc&#8230;I think this is mostly my fault. I&#8217;m completely exhausted, as always at UDS.</p>
<h2>Seed 0.8 and WebKit upstream</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m releasing Seed 0.8 later today, with all sorts of cool stuff (cairo bindings!). When looking back through commits to compile a ChangeLog, I was reminded of something that happened since the last release, that I thought might be worth bringing up. In the WebKit v. Mozilla debate, a lot of people have brought up the idea that somehow Mozilla will be a more responsive upstream to GNOME than WebKit (as WebKit is heavily funded by Apple). So, while writing the cairo bindings, I ran in to a bug in the JSCore API, and I mention in a commit message that this is &#8220;working around a WebKit bug&#8221;, and make a note to file a bug later. However, almost immediately, <a href="http://bdash.net.nz/">bdash</a> pings me in #webkit, asking about the bug (someone is watching Seed commit messages I guess), I make a reduced test case, and it&#8217;s fixed upstream about 10 minutes later. WebKit upstream has been really friendly, both to me, and the WebKit/GTK+ developers (as mentioned by xan), and though Apple does have less of an interest in free software than Mozilla (though, it could be argued that Mozilla has almost no interest in Linux), there&#8217;s a lot of interest in supporting WebKit outside of their platform, and this is good for us.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/05/18/reference-documentation-in-pdf/">Reference documentation in PDF</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Today out of (mostly) random curiosity, I wanted to investigate putting gtk-doc/docbook inside pretty PDFs. Googling around there are a lot of solutions, however none of them seem to work too well except <a href="http://dblatex.sourceforge.net/">dblatex</a>, so for the benefit of anyone else in a similar situation, probably jump straight to this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried running it on a few different things, just to see what the output is like:</p>
<p>http://gnome.org/~racarr/glib-docs.pdf</p>
<p>http://gnome.org/~racarr/pango-docs.pdf</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already pretty good, and with a little custom styling (requires making a new LaTeX document class), it could be a lot better. However, I&#8217;m not sure how much effort I want to put in, as it&#8217;s only somewhat useful.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/05/10/dbus-sandboxes-repls-life/">DBus, sandboxes, REPLs, Life</a></h4>
<p>
<p>This is probably going to read very fragmented&#8230;I&#8217;ve been coding all day and can&#8217;t really think right now.</p>
<h2>DBus</h2>
<p>So. first off, after spending all day porting code from the GJS module&#8230;</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/seed
DBus = imports.dbus;
GLib = imports.gi.GLib;

function PlayerEngine() {
    this._init();
}

PlayerEngine.prototype = {
    _init: function() {
	DBus.session.proxifyObject (this, 'org.bansheeproject.Banshee','/org/bansheeproject/Banshee/PlayerEngine');
    }
};

var PlayerEngineIface = {
    name: 'org.bansheeproject.Banshee.PlayerEngine',
    methods: [{name:'Play', inSignature: ''},
	      {name:'Open', inSignature: 's'}],
};

DBus.proxifyPrototype (PlayerEngine.prototype, PlayerEngineIface);

proxy = new PlayerEngine();
proxy.OpenRemote(Seed.argv[2]);
proxy.PlayRemote(function(){
    Seed.print("proxy.PlayRemote returned");
    Seed.quit();
});

mainloop = GLib.main_loop_new();
GLib.main_loop_run(mainloop);
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty fun! Server side part is almost done also (and is really entirely trivial to use API wise&#8230;). Big thanks to everyone working on GJS, as a significant portion of the code between the GJS/Seed DBus bindings is shared (and the rest is modeled after the GJS bindings).  </p>
<h2> Sandboxes and REPLs </h2>
<p>Seed also got a REPL with multiline input (like python)</p>
<pre>
> if (a == 3){
..  Seed.print("a is three!");
..}
</pre>
<p>It makes it a lot easier to mess around with things, and is just one of those things that seems kind of necessary to have. I also added a &#8220;sandbox&#8221; module to Seed, which lets you create a (very lightweight) context with a new global object, and you can control what you expose to it, and evaluate code in that context, it&#8217;s pretty neat because the default global object has more or less nothing exposed, so you can safely evaluate more or less anything.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>This is the obligatory life section of a blog post&#8230;I&#8217;m hope from RPI for a month, so right now I don&#8217;t have one. I do miss everyone though.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/04/25/random-updates/">Random Updates</a></h4>
<p>
<h3>Random Seed update.</h3>
<p>Quite a few bugs have been fixed since the last Seed release, including some build system improvements, some memory improvements, a few consistency things with how things are mapped, updated examples, some big optimizations to the GObject subclassing code, and a few bugfixes in the new imports sytem.</p>
<p>For some reason this morning I woke up and wrote some documentation <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~racarr/seed/mapping/mapping.html">something describing how things are mapped when importing namespaces in Seed</a>, as this is one of the most common questions I get. I think, someone who has already programmed with Gtk in C, etc&#8230;should be able to install Seed, read this, and then start coding in Seed.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I&#8217;m hoping to make a 0.5.5 release in the next week (or maybe delaying a bit if a GObject-introspection release is coming soon). I made a mistake releasing 0.5 depending on introspection from GIT.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to use twitter lately, and it&#8217;s kind of fun, <a href="http://twitter.com/racarr">follow me</a>!</p>
<h3>Random Life update</h3>
<p>School is almost over for the year, a little hard to imagine I am halfway done with undergrad&#8230;this is looking to be a great summer though.</p>
<p>Primarily I&#8217;m going to be staying in Troy, which should be really exciting, and living in an apartment by myself will be a new experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be in Barcelona for UDS Karmic (from around May 24-30th), really looking forward to this.</p>
<p>Also hoping to be able to go to Gran Canaria for the desktop summit&#8230;but this is still a little up in the air. If I do end up going I have to find a roommate. I&#8217;d kind of like to speak about Seed, but missed the deadline for registering to talk (not knowing if I was going to be able to go) and I hope if I do end up going I can work something out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a lot of time to work on various GNOME things this summer, so maybe some of my old shelved projects will get finished</p></p>

<p>Right now it&#8217;s just a somewhat outdated tutorial, some disorganized gtk-doc, and some documentation on the Seed builtins, but I think it&#8217;s a good start.</p>
<p>Before the next Seed release, I really want to take some time to write a lot more documentation, as I think Seed could be a good opportunity to introduce a lot of people to developing on top of the GNOME platform.

<h4><a href="http://www.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/blog/posts/2009/04/15/015730.html">Colemak</a></h4>
<p>
So it's now been a year since I switched my keyboard layout to Dvorak, and now it's time to change it again now to Colemak. It was very upsetting last year when I first found out about Colemak. It was about a week into the transition and I had destroyed my ability to type on any keyboard, and I was already committed to Dvorak. Colemak is supposed to be much easier for QWERTY users to switch to because there are fewer changes, so I was wondering how it would be for me coming from Dvorak.
I wanted to switch to Colemak largely so I could have Z, X, C, V in a row again for common keyboard shortcuts, as well as it supposedly being a little bit better.
So far this transition is going much faster and smoother. I started on Friday night, and by the end of the weekend I could more or less use all 3 rows of letters on the keyboard. I'm now ready to try using it full time, although it will be slow for a while, and I'll need to drop to Dvorak for passwords. It took at least a week or two in the last switch, so this is much faster. I wonder why. There are several possible reasons I've thought of. Could it be that because I already successfully changed my keyboard layout before and my brain is now keyboard trainable? Is it because of Colemak's similarity to QWERTY and something was retained (I pretty much can't use QWERTY keyboards at all anymore)? This time I learned it a row at a time instead of tiny steps adding pairs of keys on each finger and gradually adding the 1st and 3rd rows.
I hit 44 wpm on keybr, although the number of  errors I make varies.
For a while my Dvorak ability seemed to not be affected. More recently I've been experiencing some issues (which may still get worse), but it seems that for now at least my Dvorak ability has not been completely destroyed. Unlike last time when I lost all ability to use QWERTY.
So I used only Colemak to type this post, although it took forever. This is the longest block of text typed so far using Colemak. I also remember making note of my first wowomg typed with Colemak.
Alternative keyboard layouts are fun and everyone should try one, although learning and switching requires some degree of patience. It's supposedly relatively easy to switch to Colemak for QWERTY because there are few changes.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/blog/posts/2009/03/21/010730.html">WELCOME WAGON!!!</a></h4>
<p>
So Amy was coming so I built a welcome wagon. It was the greatest wagon ever constructed, out of computer cases, office chairs, duct tape, and rope I guess. Of course everything was from the dumpsters except the rope and the duct tape. Some of the cases were hard to get from the dumpsters, nd required ripping them off to the metal part which is always annoying. The rope came from walmart. Initially I took two chairs from the dumpsters, and because they were somewhat broken, and I didn't have a screwdriver, I used brute force to hybridize them. I was going to drag this wagon all the way to Albany, but it wasn't very wagonlike. So then I harvested more computer cases. I then realized it was easy to remove the wheels from the chairs, and just using the cases I could make a better wagon. I was considering walking into Albany the next day to meet Amy at the bus station, which was a long way and I likely would have died. I was initially supposed to pick her up on Thursday by myself when Nate had class and wasn't going to pick her up. She told me she was expecting me to pull out the welcome wagon, and there to be fireworks.
This would have been great because Amy would finally be coming for me in 2009. The heavy 'wagon' may have made it difficult, although I'm pretty sure I would have made it if I had no wagon and was running. Also it turned out it was raining anyway.
I couldn't attach them so I went to the engineering lab the next day to drill holes in the cases, which I did. I should have cut the other cases up to make proper walls, but I was too incompetent to do that. Then using duct tape, the wheels were held in the holes I drilled. I used rope and duct tape to join the two wheeled case pieces together. I used only duct tape to make the walls. Then Welcome Wagon signs were printed and thrown on. Also there were peeps, skittles and fake pink flowers also from the random walmart trip. I didn't manage the fireworks requested by Amy. So then with this greatest of wagons I walked into Troy to the bus station, where Nate was, and then rode the bus to Amy. Amy's primary response to the Welcome wagon was to hit me in the face with the flowers. Why is Amy so mean to me? I build her a welcome wagon and she hits me with the flowers. On the bus back the driver wanted to know if she liked the flowers or something and maybe something about if he could have them. I don't know. I'm very confused most of the time. Wagons are wagony. Wagon wagon. Wagon. I think Welcome Wagon 2.0 will need to be a vast improvement. This 1st welcome wagon didn't even roll quite properly when pulled. The wheels were poorly attached, and not all straight. I think the next one will need blinking lights, some kind of reasonable suspension, proper rolling capabilities and even sounds. I think it needs a welcome wagon song, that we will record. That would make a truly formidable wagon for maximum welcoming.

<h4><a href="http://www.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/blog/posts/2009/03/12/230055.html">Galaxy Sized Spoon: A Problem for the Ages</a></h4>
<p>
I got to wondering again about the greatest engineering problem we could ever face: the challenge of constructing a galaxy size spoon.  Forget Dyson spheres, those things are useless and easy. What we need is a galaxy size spoon. Clearly the most useful goal we should have as a race. It will likely take many generations, much patience and there will be many challenges, but I think the end result will be well worth it. There are many questions and challenging relating to the construction of this super spoon, which I hope someday to have answers to.<br /><br />So what challenges are faced in the construction of this greatest of spoons? Well the first problem I've thought of is simply if there is enough material in the universe to do it. Furthermore, what is this spoon going to be made of?<br /><br />A metal spoon? A plastic spoon? Aluminum? Iron? Copper? All of the above? Now I think a metal spoon would really be ideal. Now if we had a plastic spoon, we could use some of the hydrogen in addition to the carbon, although the mass of the carbon is much more significant, and really all these numbers are fairly arbitrary so I'll just say a plastic spoon is composed of pure carbon. Actually a pure carbon spoon would be really cool too. Then we could experiment with different allotropes of carbon. A diamond spoon! Graphite! Buckyballs?<br /><br />Now the total mass of the universe is not really known for many obvious reasons, but I've seen estimates ranging from on the order of 10⁵⁰ to 10⁶⁰ kg. I'll say 10⁵⁵ kg because it's the first number I saw when using duck duck go to find the mass of the universe. This is clearly flawless reasoning in choosing a number.<br /><br />So suppose the mass of the universe is 10⁵⁵ kg. Now of this, we only want the non-hydrogen/helium components. Now of the total mass, it's estimated only about 4% is normal matter, with the rest being the mysterious dark energy and dark matter and what not. Of that remaining normal matter, about 99% is hydrogen and helium, which aren't good spoon building materials. So about 1% of 4%, so I'll say that the amount of potentially usable material is on the order of 10⁵⁵ * 10⁻⁴ = 10⁵¹ kg. Now this includes all the elements. Most of this is going to be the more common fusion products, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, with diminishing amounts as you approach and pass iron with the whole belt of nuclear stability with the binding energy and all that, but whatever. You have 10⁵¹ kg of potentially usable material in total to use for the spoon. Now how much material do we need for such a spoon? When we say galaxy sized spoon, what do we mean? Do we mean the bowl, actual spoon part is capable of engulfing the milky way? Or do we mean from tip of the spoon to the tip of the handle is about 1 galactic diameter? I'll arbitrarily choose the second option, and say the spoon is 100,000 light years from tip of the handle to the other end.<br /><br />Now we need to estimate the volume of the spoon. So I have a spoon here I'll use as an example. I measured it to be about 15.5 cm long. The spoon part is sort of elliptical shaped, 3.2 cm and 5 cm on each axis, and about 8mm deep. The spoon is about 1mm thick in the spoon part, and 2 mm in the handle, although this varies a lot in different places, like it's 'bubbly' in the center where it kind of hollows in the bottom. The handle varies in width, from ~5mm to 1.6 cm. So the spoon is a somewhat complex shape, at least this spoon. So I'll just take ratios derived from these numbers, and assume the spoon is composed of a rectangular handle attached to a hollowed half ellipsoid, where the rectangle I'll say is 3 cm x 10.5 cm x 2 mm.<br /><br />The handle's length is then 15.5 cm - 5 cm = 10.5 cm. By calculating the volume of the volume of the half ellipsoid, and subtracting the hollow part, and adding the handle (and of course scaling up in the ratio 15.5cm:100,000 ly), I find that this crude estimate of the spoon's volume to be about 2 * 10⁶⁰ m³ of physical parts of the spoon.<br /><br />This is indeed a large spoon. Now using some density figure we can find the mass of the spoon. The question of the density is another tricky one, as it varies with temperature and pressure. What would these be in this galaxy sized spoon? The issue of pressure on different parts of the spoon is another issue to be addressed later, and temperature is another tricky one. Because I'm lazy and also have no idea what kind of things happen when you have a mass of this magnitude, I'll just say the densities of the materials are the standard ones we use under earthy conditions.<br /><br />Now calculating for different materials, I get for the mass of the spoon to be:
<ul>
	<li> Iron (ρ = 7870 kg/m³) = 1.6 * 10⁶⁴ kg</li>
	<li>Gold (for the lulz) (ρ = 19,300 kg/m³) = 4.0 * 10⁶⁴ kg</li>
	<li>Copper (ρ = 8960 kg/m³) = 1.9 * 10⁶⁴ kg</li>
	<li>Nickel (ρ = 8900 kg/m³) =  1.8 * 10⁶⁴ kg</li>
	<li>Silicon (ρ = 2330 kg/m³) = 4.8*10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Corn Syrup (ρ = 1380 kg/m³) = 2.8*10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Ice (ρ = 927 kg/m³) =  1.9 * 10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Lard (ρ = 919 kg/m³) = 1.9 * 10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Plastics (850 &lt; ρ &lt; 1400 kg/m³) = 1.8*10⁶³ - 2.9*10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Diamond (ρ = 3500 kg/m³) = 7.2 * 10⁶³ kg</li>
	<li>Graphite (ρ = 2090 kg/m³) = 4.3 * 10⁶³ kg</li>
</ul>
So we are looking at a range from 1.8*10⁶³ to 2 * 10⁶⁴ kg of material for the spoon. This is larger than even the largest figure for the total mass of the universe by several orders of magnitude, much less the figure for material we could potentially use as normal matter that isn't H or He. This is a very sad result. I’m a bit disappointed. Actually I should have realized the magnitude would be too large just from the volume before even calculating the actual mass, but I’m rather dumb so I went through all that for almost no reason. But I’m not giving up that easily. We could try refining the spoon parameters, maybe save some mass. Maybe make this a galaxy sized SPORK instead. Everyone loves sporks. Could make this a hollow spoon, or shorten the handle and change the proportions a bit. My example spoon may not have been very good.<br /><br />We could make it a mesh spoon, although that’s sort of cheating. Is it really a spoon if it’s meshed? Well probably not in the actual spoon part, but I think a "mesh" handle if feasible would work, and would save considerable mass.
Also making the surface of the spoon ’pitted’ could help save mass, in a similar way to how in Hadrian’s Pantheon has the tessellated coffers to reduce the mass so building the dome was possible.<br /><br />I remember being there and there construction or something going on which was funny because it’s an ancient building, now with scaffolding and plastic sheets being worked on.<br /><br />A smaller spoon compromise might be needed, maybe a dwarf galaxy sized spoon or something. So let us assume that we can get this spoon down to a reasonable mass. And by reasonable mass I mean a mass less than the total mass in the universe. I will arbitrarily decide this to be 1/2 of the total non-H/He matter. Or could just take the whole thing. I mean at this level of technology you probably have synthesis of any element thing from anything taken care of. Now it doesn't really matter because I’m too lazy to calculate how big of a spoon this would produce either way right now, so now the other issues should be considered.<br /><br />Next there are the obvious issues of the simple size of the spoon and delivering materials to areas being worked on. The speed of light limit when constructing a multi-lightyear ultrastructure must really be inconvenient. How would you move along the spoon? How would you navigate it? It would take many years from any given point on the spoon to see the progress on the construction of a relatively ’nearby’ part of the spoon. Obviously most of the construction would have to be taken care of by robots. These would have to be quite the robots. They would have to last for a very long time, and be able to handle the construction, and be able to supply themselves with the power. There would have to be 'gatherer' robots to acquire material and convert it into spoon construction material.<br /><br />What’s the surface of the spoon like? On one hand I envision giant bubbles holding entire civilizations that are somehow there and somehow producing energy and surviving there on the surface. Actually, they could be inside the spoon, which also may be hollow anyway to save the tons of mass necessary to make any of it possible. Now that I think of it, this is thinking of the spoon too much as an artificial planet, which it is not. It’s far too large and massive.<br /><br />The gravity problem is quite the problem. Could anything survive near it, or in it? Maybe inside the surface at certain points to have nice cancellation of forces so you don’t die. Although moving around near portions of the spoon, the tidal forces I would think would be terrible. With all this mass, could the spoon even survive? Well anyways, that’s a separate issue to think about...what about random surface features like you might see on the death star or something, but that would be an unnecessary decoration and would take a lot of extra mass. There was a name for that which was on reddit not too long ago that I don’t remember.  So from very close, the spoon’s surface would be very smooth, unless it’s easier to produce a rough, jagged surfaced spoon. Although if you’re going through all the trouble of producing this great spoon you might as well make it nice and produce a nice clean, smooth surface.<br /><br />So gravity…it’s a problem. This spoon is huge and heavy. I think it’s likely to collapse, at least without some kind of special structure or shape, which may vary considerably from my model spoon. I don’t really know how I could try calculating this. I don’t know much about structure. However, this is not your typical engineering structure problem. Instead of building some structure where the gravity of the earth is your concern, in this extraordinary case, the gravity of the structure itself is the only concern. I have very little idea how to begin calculating this. I should think about this some more. I’m not sure anyone has considered such an issue before.<br /><br />What about moving the spoon? Rotating it? With it’s huge mass, the amount of energy required to accelerate it is obviously huge as well. With a structure on the scale of thousands of light years, how does the motion propagate? What does motion even mean for a structure this big? I mean this really becomes a strange question if you have consumed all the mass and energy producing the spoon, and then there is nothing left to measure your velocity relative to, just the 1 enormous spoon that is what’s left of the universe. Would it just snap? Parts shear off? I assume it isn't a truly solid mass. We have these hollow parts now.<br /><br />However, at this point the technology to produce the spoon is such that we might as well assume the construction is perfect doesn't have any weak points or anything like that which could cause problems. I feel like the whole thing would just collapse in on itself. It’s just too massive. However, the mass is rather spread out over a large area. However, a considerable portion of the mass of the universe concentrated into the area of a small galaxy is very dense. Could this mass actually collapse to form a black hole? Is this the cycle of the universe? Civilizations form to produce a giant spoon that collapses in on itself to form a new universe?<br /><br />Now assume you can somehow generate the energy to move it. What do you do with it? Well it’s so massive, it probably pulls in stars and things into it over huge amounts of time with the whole gravity thing. You could scoop stars I guess? What would that mean? The time it takes you to move the spoon may be longer than the lifetime of the stars.<br /><br />What happens if a star or something else hits the spoon? Would it be disastrous to the integrity of the spoon? What kind of crater in the surface would it produce? I don’t think it could penetrate. There’s still a great many light years through to the other side of the spoon from any point on the surface. Although, if it is hollow, how thick are the walls? What kind of space is inside? Is this a vacuous hollow, or more of a honeycomb type of thing? Are there even stars, galaxies or other items left to scoop with so much mass incorporated into the spoon?<br /><br />Here I have a picture of what I think the spoon would look like from a very far distance. Notice you can’t see it. This is probably because you've put most of the energy of the universe into the material of the spoon, and also tapped whatever photons were flying around too. Also you've used all the nearby stars and galaxies in producing the spoon, so there’s no light sources. The spoon doesn't glow. Well if you really wanted you might try, but this brings a whole new level to the problem, bringing issues such as what parts glow, and generating power for it. You might need to do something like recapture the lost energy of the emitted light to continue emitting or something crazy if there’s nothing left.<br /><br /><img class="size-full wp-image-60" title="Galaxy Sized Spoon" src="http://files.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/galaxy-sized-spoon1.png" alt="Galaxy Sized Spoon" width="422" height="341" /><br /><br /><em>Artist's Rendition of what the spoon might look like when completed. (Whale is from open clip art)</em><br /><br />(The accompanying spacewhale oversees the construction of the spoon and also may be the vessel containing remaining civilization. The reason it is visible is not known. It also isn't clear why it's so big next to the spoon. It is a very large spacewhale. However, it could be very close. It probably isn't to scale. Although the spoon definitely is in this picture.)<br /><br />Or does the spoon glow? It should be a blackbody. But what is the temperature of the spoon? I think all this madness, between bringing all this mass together, along with all the manipulations going on it would heat up. Now heating up where? I think if it’s heated up in the portion of the spoon currently being worked on, you've got this huge surface with a heterogeneous temperature distribution, and this I think would have consequences on the structure of the spoon. You may need to take measures to keep the temperature approximately constant over the entirety of the spoon to prevent bad things from happening.<br /><br />With all these challenges, the ambition may need to be scaled down to something less impressive like a star or planet sized spoon, which is far more manageable, although all the same issues apply but many orders of magnitude less.<br /><br />So those are some of the issues I've thought of for the spoon in a somewhat random order. There are probably many more issues, some of which I've just not remembered right now. I hope to develop more thoughts on these issues, figure out how to calculate some of them and try to imagine solutions. Also there’s probably a lot of problems with my thinking about these problems and just wrong things. It’s not like I’m actually going to proofread any of this or try to make it coherent or anything.</p>

<p>
I discovered the other day that I could see my tongues' shadow if I stick it out far enough and look. I don't think I had ever seen my tongue's shadow before. It's quite the development. I'm not sure how I functioned before I knew I could see my tongue's shadow. This is even more exciting when a few months ago I discovered I could see my tongue if I stuck it out far enough. That was quite the day. My tongue got really tired.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/blog/posts/2009/02/16/055726.html">Random Thoughts and Exciting things.</a></h4>
<p>
The other day I rescued a squirrel that was trapped in the trash. It was that kind of trash can with the dome thing on the top with the door that you push in to open, but doesn't swing out. The squirrel was flailing around and trying to push itself up against the door, and falling down sometimes into the trash. That's probably the most exciting thing. I let it out and then it ran away. So sad.<br /><br />This weekend I spent my time accomplishing very little of what I planned. One thing I was working on for a while was for my next OpSys homework. The professor said we can use "any" language for our next project, so obviously it should be done in JavaScript with Seed. But the RPI CS machines running FreeBSD 6.3 obviously don't have Seed installed, so I would need to submit Seed along with the actual assignment, probably as a huge, statically linked binary. So I spent some time trying to get Seed built in a FreeBSD install in a virtual machine. Ports is really weird. I spent a long time trying to get all the dependencies for WebKit installed. Eventually I got an old WebKit from ports installed, but for some reason couldn't get one from git built, because somehow the dependencies that clearly had been installed for the ports WebKit were there. I don't understand ports. It seems to make no sense at all. I tried building gobject-introspection anyway, but the build scripts were looking for Glib headers in the wrong place, so then I forgot about that project for the rest of the weekend because autotools hates me.<br /><br />I have a list of random projects I'm trying to start working on. One of them is GHamlet. A Clutter+Seed thing that plays Hamlet. The actors are Clutter actors naturally, so GHamlet will consist of colored rectangles moving around with text appearing around them for the dialogue. So far, I've found a text file copy of the Hamlet script. A major difficulty in creating GHamlet is the stage directions. I tried inventing a system of describing actions in a way that is hopefully easily parsed, but I think I failed. There are a small number of repeatable actions, such as move on and off stage, and death. Other than that, most of the actions are unique. After spending several hours going through Hamlet and translating the stage directions, not much has changed. I probably could have simplified the directions much more for the few that are easily repeated. Oh well. It will be slightly easier to regexp a new system now at least.<br /><br />Anyway it took a long time to go through editing the file. Then today on Reddit there was a video about effective vim usage that was over an hour long. I watched it, and now my life has been revolutionized. I now know so much more about vim. My life has been revolutionized. Now I can do all kinds of magic that would have made processing Hamlet much easier. Oh well.<br /><br />While my blog may have a cornify feature, and that's fine but there's a problem: the rest of the internet is lacking unicorns. Well I plan to fix this. With the new Seed Epiphany extensions, it's on my todo list to write a cornify extension for Epiphany which will bring unicorns to everywhere you look!</p>

<p>
<p>Sooo tim told me my blog is boring so i&#8217;m going to make things more interesting.  According to Professor Millard &#8220;Pull the low hanging fruit when you can&#8230;&#8221; That is a very good theory. Of course, you don&#8217;t always see the lower fruit till you have already climbed the tree to get the higher stuff. By that point you often don&#8217;t feel like taking the easy way out, climbing down and getting the lower apple, pear, coconut or pineapple because your heart is set on that particular piece of fruit. Even though the lower one can be perfectly good.</p>
<p>To cut the story short, I&#8217;m really thirsty right now but my heart is set on waiting to get a drink till i walk home to get a drink for free when I am perfectly capable of walking down to the vending machine and purchasing one.</p>
<p><span>Can&#8217;t</span> Concentrate</p>
<p>Not^From</p>
<p>that was courtesy of Nick Demartin. Who is in fact not completely straight.<br />
Note: Parallel stuff has the same voltage. You can add voltage sources that are in series and current sources that are parallel. THIS IS IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE TEST.</p>
<p>There will be a test. because you can&#8217;t prove you know something with out a 2 hour stress bath. funny part is once we all get jobs deadlines will become a complete joke, and a concious effort will only be made to meet them in the last 15% of the time before they come.</p>
<p>THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH OATMEAL COOKIES &lt;- GOT IT???? They are delicious.</p>
<p>So today my professor got mad because the class couldn&#8217;t solve a simple problem. He doesn&#8217;t realize that if he spends 10 seconds explaining something badly it doesn&#8217;t mean we understand what he did. DUHHHHH. Gotta love bad teachers who can&#8217;t speak coherently or hear for that manner. And then he made fun of a couple of kids who were asleep. &#8220;what year are you? OH THANK GOD YOU HAVE LONGER TO GROW UP!&#8221; &#8230; I would have loled had i not been asleep a minute before due to extreme boredom.</p>
<p>Welcome to RPI.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t love it hear. it&#8217;s been the best 2 years evar.</p>
<p>Blog Blog Blog. what do normal people blog about?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any open source projects. Nothing interesting there.</p>
<p>The weekend does look boring foodwise too. I don&#8217;t forsee much time for making anything delicious. Lots of Pep Band, and maybe a trip to Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>NEXT WEEKEND HANA IS COMING! Along with Valentines day. Should be interesting?? yes. interesting.</p>
<p>Since when do I blog? I make fun of people who blog? All well. guess we all do funny things from time to time.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t have important things to blog about. Or Do I?</p>
<p>So I was at the White House the other day&#8230;</p>
<p>So I was on the Moon the other day&#8230;</p>
<p>So I was on my way to Vermont the other day&#8230;WAIT I WAS! Tim&#8217;s Aunts took me too lunch <img src="http://www.carolengelbrecht.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  it was yummy! and fun! and cute.</p>
<p>Tim is Cute.</p>
<p>He no longer says cute enough. So I&#8217;m saying it.</p>
<p><strong>CUTE</strong></p>
<p>S&#8217;ALL LOVE!</p></p>
